Dataset : Iris Dataset

1) Data Collection:

Obtain the dataset you want to explore. This may involve collecting data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or files.


2)Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values: Identify and handle missing data points through imputation or removal.
Remove duplicates: Check for and remove any duplicate records.
Correct data types: Ensure that data types are appropriate for analysis.

3)Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.) to describe the main features of the dataset.
Use tools like pandas in Python or summary functions in R for these calculations.

4)Univariate Analysis:

Explore individual variables one at a time.
Use histograms, box plots, and summary statistics to understand the distribution of each variable.
Identify outliers and anomalies.

5)Bivariate Analysis:

Explore relationships between two variables.
Use scatter plots, correlation matrices, or heatmaps to visualize correlations.
Group data based on certain criteria and analyze the relationship between variables within these groups.

5)Multivariate Analysis:

Explore relationships between more than two variables.
Use techniques like pair plots, 3D scatter plots, or parallel coordinates to visualize complex interactions.

6)Data Visualization:

Utilize various graphs and charts to visualize patterns in the data.
Common visualizations include bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and heatmaps.

7)Outlier Detection:

Identify and examine outliers that may skew the analysis.
Box plots, scatter plots, and statistical methods can be used for outlier detection.

8)Feature Engineering:

Create new features that might provide more meaningful insights.
Extract relevant information from existing features.

9)Pattern Recognition:

Look for patterns and trends in the data.
Time series analysis, clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques can aid in pattern recognition.

10) Hypothesis Testing:

Formulate and test hypotheses based on the observed data.
Use statistical tests to validate assumptions.
